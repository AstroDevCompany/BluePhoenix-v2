# The dashboard

The dashboard lists all your projects as cards. Starred projects and recently opened ones come first.

## What a card shows

- **Title** and, if you wrote one, a short **description**. The project type (for example Tauri or Python) appears next to the title.
- **Branch row:** the branch your folder is on right now (not the repository's default branch) and its state:

  | Badge | Meaning |
  | --- | --- |
  | **Up to date** | Nothing to commit, nothing to push or pull. |
  | **N uncommitted changes** | You have edited, staged or new files. |
  | **N to push** | You have commits that are not on the remote yet. |
  | **N to pull** | The remote has commits you do not have. Run **Fetch** first to refresh this number. |
  | **Diverged** | Both of the above. |
  | **N conflicts** | A merge needs your attention. |
  | **No upstream** | The branch is not linked to a remote branch yet. A push will set that up. |
  | **Not a git repo** | The folder is not under git. Open the project's Git tab to run `git init`. |

- **Facts:** total time tracked, number of open to-dos, and when the project was last updated (the newest of your last commit, to-do or time entry).
- **Actions** below the divider:
  - **Open in …** opens the folder in your default editor. The arrow lets you pick another editor, the embedded terminal, your system terminal, or reveal the folder.
  - **Run command** (blue) runs the project's main command, usually the build. The arrow lists all the project's commands so you can run another one instead.

## Star and menu

- The **star** at the top right of a card adds the project to your favourites. Use the **Favorites** filter at the top of the dashboard to show only those.
- The **⋯** menu has: open in terminal, reveal folder, fetch, pull, push, stash changes, apply last stash, open GitHub, open website, edit and remove project.

Click anywhere else on the card to open the full project page.

## Keeping it fresh

Branch states refresh when you bring the window to the front and once a minute. Fetch, pull and push buttons refresh them immediately.
